Software Maintenance and Refactoring
Objective: Practice software maintenance and refactoring.
Activities:
Identify code smells in a given codebase.
Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
Ensure that the refactored code passes all tests.
Document the changes made.
Deliverables: Submit the original and refactored code, along with a report on the refactoring process.

#include <stdio.h>

// Original code with code smells
int calculate_and_print(int a, int b, int operation) {
    int result;
    if (operation == 1) { // 1 means addition
        result = a + b;
        printf("Addition result: %d\n", result);
    } else if (operation == 2) { // 2 means subtraction
        result = a - b;
        printf("Subtraction result: %d\n", result);
    } else if (operation == 3) { // 3 means multiplication
        result = a * b;
        printf("Multiplication result: %d\n", result);
    } else {
        printf("Invalid operation\n");
        return -1; // Indicate error
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    calculate_and_print(10, 5, 1);
    calculate_and_print(10, 5, 2);
    calculate_and_print(10, 5, 3);
    calculate_and_print(10, 5, 4);

    return 0;
}

// Refactored Code
#include <stdio.h>

// Using enums for better readability
typedef enum {
    ADDITION = 1,
    SUBTRACTION,
    MULTIPLICATION,
    INVALID
} Operation;

// Function to perform the calculation

Code Smells and Refactoring:
 * Magic Numbers:
   * The original code used 1, 2, and 3 to represent operations. These are "magic numbers" as their meaning is not immediately clear.
   * Refactoring: An enum called Operation was introduced to give meaningful names (ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION) to these numbers.
 * Long Method/Single Responsibility Principle:
   * The calculate_and_print function performed both calculation and printing. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
   * Refactoring: The code was split into two functions: calculate (for calculations) and print_result (for printing). This separates the concerns.
 * Conditional Logic (if/else if):
   * The original code used a series of if/else if statements to determine the operation.
   * Refactoring: A switch statement was used, which is generally more readable and efficient for handling multiple cases based on a single variable.
 * Readability:
   * Using the enums, and separating the functions, makes the code easier to read and understand.
 * Maintainability:
   * If you need to add a new operation, it's now much easier to do so by adding a new enum value and a corresponding case in the calculate and print_result functions.
 * Error Handling:
   * Both versions handle invalid input, though the refactored version does so in a more readable way.
How to Practice:
 * Compile and Run: Compile and run both the original and refactored code to ensure they produce the same output for valid inputs.
 * Add New Operations: Try adding a division operation to both versions of the code. Notice how much easier it is to do in the refactored version.
 * Introduce More Complex Logic: Try adding more complex calculations or error handling to both versions.
 * Write Test Cases: If you're comfortable with unit testing, write test cases to verify the correctness of both versions.
 * Experiment: Change the inputs and observe the outputs. Try to break the code and see how it handles errors.
