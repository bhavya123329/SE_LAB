create a CI/CD pipeline guide using a simple C example, focusing on GitHub Actions.
1. Project Setup:
 * Create a GitHub repository.
 * Create a main.c file with your C code (use the simple C example from my previous response).
 * Create a Makefile for building your C program.
 * Create a .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file for the GitHub Actions workflow.

2. main.c (Your C Code):
#include <stdio.h>

 int main() {
  int num1 = 10;
  int num2 = 5;
  int sum = num1 + num2;

  printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);

  return 0;
}

3. Makefile (Build Instructions):
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra

all: main

main: main.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.c -o main

clean:
        rm -f main

Explanation of Makefile:
 * CC = gcc: Sets the compiler to GCC.
 * CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra: Sets compiler flags for warnings.
 * all: main: Defines the default target, which builds main.
 * main: main.c: Specifies that main depends on main.c.
 * $(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.c -o main: Compiles main.c into an executable named main.
 * clean: rm -f main: Defines a target to remove the executable.

4. .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml (GitHub Actions Workflow):
name: C CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install GCC
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gcc

      - name: Build
        run: make

      - name: Run
        run: ./main

  deploy-staging:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: staging
    steps:
      - name: Simulate deployment
        run: echo "Simulating deployment to staging..."

Explanation of Workflow:
 * on: Defines when the workflow runs (on push or pull request to main).
 * jobs: Defines the jobs in the workflow.
   * build:
     * runs-on: ubuntu-latest: Runs the job on an Ubuntu virtual machine.
     * steps: Defines the steps in the job.
       * Checkout code: Checks out the code from the repository.
       * Install GCC: Installs the GCC compiler.
       * Build: Runs make to build the program.
       * Run: Executes the compiled program.
   * deploy-staging:
     * needs: build: Ensures the build job completes successfully before running.
     * environment: {name: staging}: defines the environment as staging.
     * Simulate deployment: Simulates a deployment to a staging environment.

5. Steps to Set Up:
 * Commit and Push: Commit and push all the files to your GitHub repository.
 * GitHub Actions: Go to your repository on GitHub and click on the "Actions" tab.
 * Workflow Run: You'll see the workflow running. Click on it to see the progress.
 * Monitoring: Monitor the workflow's progress and check the logs for any errors.
 * Fixing Issues: If the build or run steps fail, check the logs to identify the problem and fix your code or Makefile.
 * Simulated Deployment: Observe the simulated deployment step.
 * Real Deployment (Enhancement): To make this a real deployment, replace the "Simulate deployment" step with actual deployment commands:
   * If deploying to a server, you could use scp to copy the executable.
   * If deploying to a cloud platform, you might use the platform's CLI tools.
Example of an error and fix:
 * Error: If you forgot to install GCC, the build step will fail.
 * Fix: Add the "Install GCC" step to the workflow file.
 * Error: if there is a syntax error in the c code, the make command will fail.
 * Fix: Fix the syntax error in the c code.
This guide provides a basic CI/CD pipeline setup for a C program using GitHub Actions. You can expand it by adding more tests, deployment steps, and other features as needed.
